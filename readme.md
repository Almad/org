During the growth of Mews organization, we realized that we not only build SaaS product for our customers, but also we build the organization itself. There are lots of guides on how to develop an application, but much less guides on **how to build a tech company**. For example how to structure engineering department, how to establish career ladders, how to determine salaries, what are some helpful processes, how to run code reviews or postmortems etc. etc.

And we don't need to stop at boundaries of technical department, there are even less resources when it comes to finance, reporting, planning, building P&L or structuring cost centers. And it's the similar case for other departments or roles in standard tech company. Therefore we decided to **share our practices**, processes, frameworks and guidelines, following the open-source philosophy.
