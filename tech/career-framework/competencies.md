# Competencies

We're using [Etsy's competency model](https://etsy.github.io/Etsy-Engineering-Career-Ladder/competencies.html) which is a set of engineering competencies and skills several other big companies collaborated on, e.g. including Spotify. What we like the most about the model is, that it is actually **very ambitious** and in order to get to the top level in some competencies, it really requires technical or other excellence and industry thought leadership. It is not a shame at all if your level would be beginner in most of the competencies, level advanced already represents rather senior people. Level expert or especially leading expert truly means an industry expert and there are not many of those.

It is supposed to be aspirational, so if you're not sure, put in lower score or level. The **goal is to get better**, the goal is not to check all the boxes. The competency model is designed primarily for engineers, but with a little bit of stretch and interpretation, it is usable for all divisions and roles within technical department. There are five competencies:

- 🚚 **Delivery** - Planning, prioritization, predictability, continuous delivery, testing and monitoring.
- 📚 **Domain Expertise** - Knowledge of your domain, tools, business, product.
- 💡 **Problem Solving** - Analysis, creativity, breakdown of problems, architecture of solutions.
- 💬 **Communication** - Collaboration with others, documentation, relationships with others.
- 🎖️ **Leadership** - Responsibility, decision making, mentoring, setting an example.

## Skills

A competency consists of levels and skills. There are many **skills**, for example "You test your work following relevant examples." That is a skill within the delivery competency  on the beginner level. For each skill you should asses whether you posses the skill using the following scores:

- **0 - Nope** - Not at all, meaning that you don't possess the skill.
- **1 - Somewhat** - Having the skill somewhat, but not fully there yet.
- **2 - Yes** - Fully possessing the skill, being able to provide multiple examples demonstrating it consistently. Also the skill should be persistent, meaning that you should not stop practicing the skill when you achieve it.

## Levels

Each of the competencies has six levels of expertise, which can be summarized as follows:

- **0 - Starter** - At the beginning of the learning path, not demonstrating the competency yet.
- **1 - Beginner** - Possessing basics of the competency, still rather junior, lot of guidance is needed.
- **2 - Intermediate** - Progressing further within the competency, mid-level, guidance is required sometimes.
- **3 - Advanced** - Having more advanced skills, senior in the role, being able to guide others.
- **4 - Expert** - Being able to pass on the knowledge and have impact on other teams or departments.
- **5 - Leading Expert** - Proven impact within the company, advancing the industry forward, thought leader.

As mentioned above, the competencies are rather aspirational, so to get to level 3 is already big achievement. Levels above it require you in many cases to have impact past the standard boundaries of the competency and to affect whole organization or industry. It might take quite some time to reach a new level, so do not get discouraged, if you are not advancing every six months. For the sake of completeness, in order to reach a level, these are the three conditions necessary:

1. You must reach the previous level (= you cannot skip levels).
2. There should be no skill on the level with score 0 (= you cannot have a skill gap).
3. Average score of skills on the level has to be greater than 1.7 (= you must fully demonstrate most of the skills).
