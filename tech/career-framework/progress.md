# Progress

In order to determine your progress and how far you are in your career track, you take [levels](competencies.md#levels) of each [competency](competencies.md) (number between 0 and 5) and apply weighted average on them. This way, you get to single number, again between 0 and 5, which represents your overall **career progress**. It can be interpreted as a measure of seniority, with 0 being a novice and 5 being a world-class thought leader.

The weights are different for each [career track](tracks/readme.md) and they capture the fact that different competencies have various importance in different tracks. For example delivery is important for individual contributor, very important for team lead, but not that important for a family lead who is on contrary focused more on leadership and communication.

## Example

As an example, let's consider a standard engineer career track, whose weights might look something like this (please note that this is just an example of how the weights might look like, specific weights are defined for each career track):

- **25%** 🚚 Delivery
- **30%** 📚 Domain Expertise
- **30%** 💡 Problem Solving
- **10%** 💬 Communication
- **5%** 🎖️ Leadership

Now, let's say the person has reached level 3 in delivery and domain expertise and level 2 in the rest of competencies. That means their overall career progress is **2.55** as per the following calculation:

`3 × 0.25 + 3 × 0.30 + 2 × 0.30 + 2 × 0.10 + 2 × 0.05 = 2.55`
